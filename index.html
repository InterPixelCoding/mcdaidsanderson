        <p class="hidden"><span>McDaid & Sanderson</span> brings together 2 experienced singers, a great guitarist, and a violinist/viola player of qualityâ€¦ all at once!</p>
        <p class="hidden">Brian and Michael met in the south of England playing in the folk band Kinfolk. Michael saw the light in 2017 and joined Brian in the North, Brian having moved back to his native Glasgow some years before. Despite the frustrations of the last few years, they have now cultivated a unique sound with traditional Celtic roots, whilst mixing in their other musical influences. With very different musical backgrounds, Brian and Michael now have an unstoppable creative duo using the colours of blues, jazz, classical, country and bluegrass to feed into the Celtic sound. Brian is a prolific song writer and has been leading folk and rock bands all his life, with many BBC radio performances and tours throughout England and Ireland to his name. Michael ran a ceilidh band in the south of England for 30 years, but is more widely known in the Classical music world as a singer and violinist, specialising in Baroque 17 th &amp; 18 th C music.</p>
        <p class="hidden"><span>McDaid & Sanderson</span> has already established a growing fanbase in Glasgow and Cumbria, and is now setting out to bring their music to the wider family of folk enthusiasts at home and abroad.</p>
